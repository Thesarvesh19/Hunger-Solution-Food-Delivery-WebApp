The Hunger Solution 🍔🍕
The Hunger Solution is a modern, fully responsive, and feature-rich front-end for a food ordering and delivery website. Built from the ground up using only Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, this project showcases a complete user flow from browsing the menu to placing an order. It's designed with a focus on great user experience, clean code, and a visually appealing interface.

✨ Key Features
🎨 Dual-Theme Interface: Seamlessly switch between a beautiful light mode and a comfortable dark mode. Your preference is saved in localStorage for future visits.

🍽️ Dynamic Menu Rendering: The entire menu is rendered dynamically from a JavaScript object, complete with category filters (Pizza, Burgers, Indian, etc.) for easy navigation.

🛒 Interactive Shopping Cart: A sleek, slide-out cart sidebar allows users to add items, adjust quantities, and see the total cost update in real-time. The cart's state is persistent across browser sessions using localStorage.

💳 Multi-Step Checkout Modal: A clean, multi-step process for checkout that guides the user through entering shipping details, selecting a payment method, and finally, viewing an order confirmation receipt.

⭐ Customer Review System: Users can submit their own reviews with a star rating. New reviews are added dynamically and saved to localStorage, making the feedback system persistent.

📱 Fully Responsive Design: The layout is optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors, using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid.

🚀 Smooth Animations & UX: Subtle animations on scroll (IntersectionObserver), hover effects, and toast notifications provide a polished and professional user experience.
